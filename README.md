## Techy Blog

## Description
For this challenge  I was to create a blog that users can interact with and post, share and save posts.
For this challenge I ran into a lot of issues trying to get my server to work and had to rewrite a few files of code. 
I havent been able to get into my Heroku because my key (my phone) was damaged beyond repair. 
Im hoping to be able to work on this challenge further and get into my Heroku and get my local server to work.
I just want to get this submitted for now so that I dont have a missing assignment. 
I'm hoping my code that I have written will work as I've compared it to previous challenges that are similar.
