## Techy Blog

## Description
For this challenge  I was to create a blog that users can interact with and post, share and save posts.
For this challenge I ran into a lot of issues trying to get my server to work and had to rewrite a few files of code. 
I havent been able to get into my Heroku because my key (my phone) was damaged beyond repair. I havent been able to see what my website actually looks like yet because of this
And because I cant get my server to work Im not able to view it on a local server. Im hoping to be able to work on this challenge further and get into my Heroku and get my local server to work.
I just want to get this submitted for now so that I dont have a missing assignment. 
I'm hoping my code that I have written will work as I've compared it to previous challenges that are similar.
